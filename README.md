## Let's Solve The Breach Protocol from CYBERPUNK 2077 Using Brute Force Algorithm!
## A mini project made by Thea Josephine 13522012

## Description 🫧
#### This simple project was made to solve the Breach Protocol problem from Cyberpunk 2077 using brute force algorithm. User could use a file input or enter inputs by terminal CLI (randomized matrix and sequences). You could also save the result as a txt

## Requirements 🫴 
#### None!

## Setting Up 🍀
- Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/pandaandsushi/Tucil1_13522012.git`
- Make sure to add your input file beforehand on bin > dist > main.
- Click on the `main.exe` to launch the program
- You're done!

## How to use 🌿
- Launch the executable
- Choose the type of input you want to: by file (customized) or CLI (randomized)
- If using file input, make sure your .txt file is in the same directory with the .exe. 
- If using CLI input, enter your desired matrix size, number of sequence, and so on.
- The program will calculate the best solution that has the most points and shorter
- You can decide to save the result or not as a txt file.

## At last, enjoy :>
